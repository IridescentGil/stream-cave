# stream-cave

stream-cave is a rust program to monitor livestreams and play them when they go live.

## Building

stream-cave requires mpv, yt-dlp and openssl as dependancies to run.

## Testing

twitch-cli is needed for testing.
Due to limitations of twitch-cli and use of twitch API's work is needed to create betteer test coverage.
